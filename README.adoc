= Building true-to-production integration tests with Testcontainers

[.hidden]
NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

Learn how to test your microservices with multiple containers using Testcontainers and JUnit.

== What you'll learn

You'll learn how to write true-to-production integration tests for Java microservices by using https://www.testcontainers.org/[Testcontainers^] and JUnit. You'll learn to set up and configure multiple containers, including the Open Liberty Docker container, to simulate a production-like environment for your tests.

Sometimes tests might pass in development and testing (dev/test) environments, but fail in production because the application runs differently in production than in dev/test. Fortunately, you can minimize these differences between dev/test and production by testing your application in the same Docker containers that you'll use in production.

=== What is Testcontainers?

Testcontainers is an open source library that wraps Docker in a Java API. It is often used in testing applications that involve external resource dependencies such as databases, message queues, or web services. Testcontainers supports any container image, which allows for uniform and portable testing environments. By encapsulating dependencies in containers, it ensures test consistency and simplifies the setup process.

The microservice that you'll be working with is called `inventory`. The `inventory` microservice persists data into a PostgreSQL database and supports create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on the database records. You will write integration tests for the application by using Testcontainers to run it in Docker containers.

== Additional prerequisites

Before you begin, Docker needs to be installed. For installation instructions, refer to the https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[official Docker documentation^]. You'll test the application in Docker containers.

Make sure to start your Docker daemon before you proceed.

// =================================================================================================

// =================================================================================================
=== Try what you'll build

This guide uses Docker to run an instance of the PostgreSQL database for a fast installation and setup. A Dockerfile file is provided for you. Navigate to the `postgres` directory and run the following commands to use the Dockerfile to build the image:

[role='command']
```
cd postgres
docker build -t postgres-sample .
```

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the test, first go to the `finish` directory and run the `mvn package` command so that the `.war` file resides in the `target` directory, and the `.jar` PostgreSQL JDBC driver file resides in the `target/liberty/wlp/usr/shared/resources` directory:

[role='command']
```
cd ../finish
mvn package
```

Build the `inventory` container image with the following command:

[role='command']
```
docker build -t inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT .
```

Now, run the Maven `verify` goal, which compiles the Java files, starts the containers, runs the tests, and then stops the containers.

[.tab_link.windows_link]
`*WINDOWS*`
[.tab_link.mac_link]
`*MAC*`
[.tab_link.linux_link]
`*LINUX*`
[.tab_content.windows_section.mac_section]
--
[role='command']
```
mvn verify
```
--
[.tab_content.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
export TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true
mvn verify -Dtest.protocol=http
```
--

You will see the following output:

[role="no_copy"]

== Implementing integration tests to use Testcontainers

You'll develop integration tests capable of running in both https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html[dev mode^] and a CI/CD pipeline. These flexible tests ensure the application's reliability across diverse environments.

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

The PostgreSQL database is integral for the `inventory` microservice as it handles the persistence of data. Run the following command to start the PostgreSQL database, which runs the `postgres-sample` image in a Docker container and maps `5432` port from the container to your host machine:

[role='command']
```
docker run --name postgres-container --rm -p 5432:5432 -d postgres-sample
```

Retrieve the PostgreSQL container IP address by running the following command:

[role='command']
```
docker inspect -f "{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}" postgres-container
```

The command returns the PostgreSQL container IP address:

[role="no_copy"]
----
172.17.0.2
----

The Open Liberty Maven plug-in includes a `devc` goal that simplifies developing your application in a container by starting dev mode with container support. This goal builds a container image, mounts the required directories, binds the required ports, and then runs the application inside of a container. Dev mode also listens for any changes in the application source code or configuration and rebuilds the image and restarts the container as necessary.

Build and run the container by running the `devc` goal with the PostgreSQL container IP address. If your PostgreSQL container IP address is not `172.17.0.2`, replace the command with the right IP address.

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:devc -DdockerRunOpts="-e DB_HOSTNAME=172.17.0.2" -DserverStartTimeout=240
```

You need to wait a while to let dev mode start. After you see the following message, your Liberty instance is ready in dev mode:

[role="no_copy"]
----
**************************************************************
*    Liberty is running in dev mode.
*    ...
*    Docker network information:
*        Container name: [ liberty-dev ]
*        IP address [ 172.17.0.3 ] on Docker network [ bridge ]
*    ...
----

Dev mode holds your command-line session to listen for file changes. Open another command-line session to continue, or open the project in your editor.

Point your browser to the http://localhost:9080/openapi/ui URL to try out the `inventory` microservice manually. This interface provides a convenient visual way to interact with the APIs and test out their functionalities. 

=== Building test REST client

Test REST client is responsible for sending HTTP requests to an application and handling the responses. It enables accurate verification of the application's behavior by ensuring that it responds correctly to various scenarios and conditions. Using a REST client for testing ensures reliable interaction with the `inventory` microservice across various deployment environments: local, Docker container, or Testcontainers.

Begin by creating a test REST client interface for the `inventory` microservice.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SystemResourceClient` class.#
`src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/SystemResourceClient.java`
----

// file 0
SystemResourceClient.java
[source, java, linenums, role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/SystemResourceClient.java[]
----

The [hotspot file=0]`SystemResourceClient` interface declares the [hotspot=listContents file=0]`listContents()`, [hotspot=getSystem file=0]`getSystem()`, [hotspot=addSystem file=0]`addSystem()`, [hotspot=updateSystem file=0]`updateSystem()`, and [hotspot=removeSystem file=0]`removeSystem()` methods for accessing the corresponding endpoints within the `inventory` microservice.

Next, create the `SystemData` data model for testing.

[role="code_command hotspot file=1" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SystemData` class.#
`src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/SystemData.java`
----

// file 1
SystemData.java
[source, java, linenums, role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/SystemData.java[]
----

The [hotspot file=1]`SystemData` class contains the ID, hostname, operating system name, Java version, and heap size properties. The various [hotspot=getMethods file=1]`get` and [hotspot=setMethods file=1]`set` methods within this class enable you to view and edit the properties of each system in the inventory.

=== Building test container for Open Liberty

Next, you'll learn to create a custom class that extends Testcontainers' generic container to define specific configurations that suit your application's requirements.

Define a custom `LibertyContainer` class, which provides a framework to start and access a containerized version of the Open Liberty application for testing.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `LibertyContainer` class.#
`src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/LibertyContainer.java`
----

// file 0
LibertyContainer.java
[source, java, linenums, role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/LibertyContainer.java[]
----

The [hotspot file=0]`LibertyContainer` class extends the [hotspot=GenericContainer file=0]`GenericContainer` class from Testcontainers to create a custom container configuration specific to the Open Liberty application.

The [hotspot=addExposedPorts1 hotspot=addExposedPorts2 file=0]`addExposedPorts()` method exposes specified ports from the container's perspective, allowing test clients to communicate with services running inside the container. To avoid any port conflicts, Testcontainers assigns random host ports to these exposed container ports. 

By default, the [hotspot=waitingFor file=0]`Wait.forLogMessage()` method directs `LibertyContainer` to wait for the specific `CWWKF0011I` log message that indicates the Liberty instance has started successfully.

The [hotspot=getBaseURL file=0]`getBaseURL()` method contructs the base URL to access the container.

For more information about Testcontainers APIs and its functionality, refer to the https://javadoc.io/doc/org.testcontainers/testcontainers/latest/index.html[Testcontainers JavaDocs^].


=== Building test cases

Next, you'll learn to write tests that use the `SystemResourceClient` REST client and the Testcontainers integration. You'll set up a multi-container test environment, determine the appropriate environment to launch Testcontainers, and configure the test REST client for HTTPS communication.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SystemResourceIT` class.#
`src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/SystemResourceIT.java`
----

// file 0
SystemResourceIT.java
[source, java, linenums, role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/SystemResourceIT.java[]
----

// file 1
LibertyContainer.java
[source, java, linenums, role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/LibertyContainer.java[]
----

Use [hotspot=GenericContainer file=0]`GenericContainer` class to create the [hotspot=postgresContainer file=0]`postgresContainer` test container to start up the PostgreSQL container image, and use the [hotspot=LibertyContainer file=0]`LibertyContainer` custom class to create the [hotspot=inventoryContainer file=0]`inventoryContainer` test container to start up the `inventory` container image. Because containers are isolated by default, make sure both containers use the same [hotspot=network1 hotspot=network2 hotspot=network3 file=0]`network` for them to communicate.

// file 2
ReadinessCheck.java
[source, java, linenums, role="code_column hide_tags=copyright"]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/health/ReadinessCheck.java[]
----

Because the `inventory` service provides the [hotspot file=2]`/health/ready` health readiness check, call the [hotspot=waitingFor file=0]`waitingFor()` method again to override the default [hotspot=waitingFor file=1]`waitingFor()` method in [hotspot file=1]`LibertyContainer`. That ensures the `inventoryContainer` is ready before tests run by checking the [hotspot=waitingFor file=0]`/health/ready` REST API instead of the log message. For different container readiness check customizations, refer to the https://www.testcontainers.org/features/startup_and_waits/[official Testcontainers documentation^].

The [hotspot=getLogger file=0]`LoggerFactory.getLogger()` and [hotspot=withLogConsumer1 hotspot=withLogConsumer2 file=0]`withLogConsumer(new Slf4jLogConsumer(Logger))` methods integrate container logs with the test logs by piping the container output to the specified logger.

The [hotspot=createRestClient file=0]`createRestClient()` method creates a REST client instance with the `SystemResourceClient` interface.

The [hotspot=setup file=0]`setup()` method prepares the test environment. It checks whether the test is running in dev mode or there is a local running Liberty instance, by using the [hotspot=isServiceRunning file=0]`isServiceRunning()` helper. In the case of no running Liberty instance, the test starts the [hotspot=postgresContainerStart file=0]`postgresContainer` and [hotspot=inventoryContainerStart file=0]`inventoryContainer` test containers. Otherwise, it ensures that the Postgres database is running locally.

The [hotspot=testAddSystem file=0]`testAddSystem()` verifies the [hotspot=addSystem file=0]`addSystem` and [hotspot=listContents file=0]`listContents` endpoints.

The [hotspot=testUpdateSystem file=0]`testUpdateSystem()` verifies the [hotspot=updateSystem file=0]`updateSystem` and [hotspot=getSystem file=0]`getSystem` endpoints.

The [hotspot=testRemoveSystem file=0]`testRemoveSystem()` verifies the [hotspot=removeSystem file=0]`removeSystem` endpoint.

After tests, the [hotspot=tearDown file=0]`tearDown()` method stops the containers and closes the network.


=== Setting up logs

Having reliable logs is essential for efficient debugging, as they provide detailed insights into the test execution flow and help pinpoint issues during test failures. Testcontainers' built-in `Slf4jLogConsumer` enables integration of container output directly with the JUnit process, enhancing log analysis and simplifying test creation and debugging.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `log4j.properties` file.#
`src/test/resources/log4j.properties`
----

// file 0
log4j.properties
[source, properties, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/test/resources/log4j.properties[]
----

The [hotspot file=0]`log4j.properties` file configures the root logger, appenders, and layouts for console output. It sets the logging level to `DEBUG` for the [hotspot=package file=0]`it.io.openliberty.guides.inventory` package. This level provides detailed logging information for the specified package, which can be helpful for debugging and understanding test behavior.


=== Configuring Maven project

Next, you'll learn to prepare your Maven project for test execution. You'll add the required dependencies for Testcontainers and logging, set up Maven to copy the PostgreSQL JDBC driver during the build phase, and configure the Liberty Maven Plugin to handle PostgreSQL dependency.


[role="code_command hotspot file=0" ,subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `pom.xml` file.#
`pom.xml`
----

// file 0
pom.xml
[source, XML, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/pom.xml[]
----

Add the required `dependency` for Testcontainers and Log4J libraries with `test` scope. The [hotspot=testcontainers file=0]`testcontainers` dependency offers a general-purpose API for managing container-based test environments. The [hotspot=slf4j file=0]`slf4j-reload4j` and [hotspot=slf4j-api file=0]`slf4j-api` dependencies enable the Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) API for trace logging during test execution and facilitates debugging and test performance tracking. 

The Maven pom.xml file contains a configuration for the [hotspot=maven-dependency-plugin file=0]`maven-dependency-plugin` to copy the PostgreSQL JDBC driver into the Liberty configuration's shared resources directory. This setup occurs during the `prepare-package` phase. As a result, running the `mvn package` command ensures the PostgreSQL driver is prepared and accessible for your application when it runs on the Liberty.

Also, add and configure the [hotspot=failsafe file=0]`maven-failsafe-plugin` plugin, so that the integration test can be run by the Maven `verify` goal.

Because you started Open Liberty in dev mode, all the changes were automatically picked up. You can run the tests by pressing the `enter/return` key from the command-line session where you started dev mode. You will see the following output:

[role="no_copy"]

== Running tests in a CI/CD pipeline

Running tests in dev mode is useful for local development, but there may be times when you want to test your application in other scenarios, such as in a CI/CD pipeline. For these cases, you can use Testcontainers to run tests against a running Open Liberty instance in a controlled, self-contained environment, ensuring that your tests run consistently regardless of the deployment context.

To test outside of dev mode, exit dev mode by pressing `CTRL+C` in the command-line session where you ran the Liberty, or by typing `q` and then pressing the `enter/return` key.

Also, run the following commands to stop the PostgreSQL container that was started in the previous section:

[role='command']
```
docker stop postgres-container
```

Because you have already built the `inventory` container image in the *Try what you'll build* section, there's no need to build it again here.

Now, use the following Maven goal to run the tests from a cold start outside of dev mode:

[.tab_link.windows_link]
`*WINDOWS*`
[.tab_link.mac_link]
`*MAC*`
[.tab_link.linux_link]
`*LINUX*`
[.tab_content.windows_section.mac_section]
--
[role='command']
```
mvn verify
```
--
[.tab_content.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
export TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true
mvn verify -Dtest.protocol=http
```
--

You will see the following output:

Notice that the test initiates a new Docker container each for the PostgreSQL database and the `inventory` microservice, resulting in a longer test runtime. Despite this, cold start testing benefits from a clean instance per run and ensures consistent results. These tests also automatically hook into existing build pipelines that are set up to run the `integration-test` phase.
